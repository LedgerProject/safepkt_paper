This paper provides a formal foundation of the semantics of
a significant subset of the Rust programming
language, defines a type system over it, and gives a soundness proof
of the type system through the formal framework of abstract interpretation.
This allows one to derive proofs of specific features of the
type system of Rust, including borrowing of values and their related
constraints, that are simpler than those already proposed in the past,
since abstract intepretation provides a standard
methodology for definitions and proofs.
The same semantics is the basis of future implementations of static analyses
for Rust, built over this formal framework.
