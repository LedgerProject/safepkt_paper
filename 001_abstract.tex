A distinguished feature of the Rust programming language
is its ability to deallocate dynamically-allocated
data structures as soon as it goes out of scope, without relying on a garbage
collector. At the same time, Rust lets programmers create references,
called \emph{borrows}, to data structures. A borrow static checker enforces
that borrows can only be used in a controlled way, so that dangling references cannot arise.
The borrow checker has been formalized and proved correct~\cite{Pearce21}, although there
are situations when that checker might fail to terminate.
This paper provides a sufficient condition that guarantees termination for the borrow checker
of Rust and proves that that condition holds for programs that do not make use of \emph{reborrows}
(check at the end if this latter property actually holds).
