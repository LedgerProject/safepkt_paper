\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

This section will introduce the context of the paper: Rust, its very
specific type system that guarantees memory safety, attempts and difficulties
of its formalizations, the advantage of a formalization based on abstract
interpretation (never done before for the type system of Rust).

Expressions whose type is a box or a mutable borrow are said to have move semantics.
All other expressions have copy semantics.
