\section{Implementation}\label{sec:implementation}

This section will present the implementation of the abstract semantics
for the subset of Rust considered in the paper. This implementation can be
used to improve the precision of type-checking of existing compilers,
by allowing more code to be type-checked and executed. Moreover,
types can be used to identify variables that can never be aliased, because
they have distinct, incompatible types. Code working on such variables can
then be run in distinct threads and automatically parallelized.
Finally, the abstract semantics can be the basis of static analyses,
different from type-checking, that can be defined, proved correct and
added to existing static analyzers for Rust.
