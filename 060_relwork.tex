\section{Related Work}


Reed provided an early formalisation of Rust called ``Patina'' which
shares some similarities with \FR/~\cite{Reed15}.  For example, it
employs a flow-sensitive type system for characterising borrow
checking which operates over a ``shadow'' heap.  However, the scope
was significantly larger and, as such, soundness was not established.
Likewise, Wang {\em et al.} presented a formal, executable operational
semantics for Rust called KRust~\cite{WSZZZ18}.  This was defined in
$\mathbb{K}$ --- a rewrite-based executable semantic framework
particularly suited at developing operational semantics~\cite{RS10b}.
A large subset of Rust was defined in this way and partially validated
against the official Rust test suite.  Another example is that of
Weiss {\em et al.} presented an unpublished system called {\em Oxide}
which bears striking similarity with \FR/~\cite{WPMA19}.  Oxide was
also inspired by Featherweight Java to produce a relatively lean
formalisation of Rust.  Again, it includes a far larger subset of Rust
than \FR/ (perhaps making it more {\em middleweight} than {\em
  featherweight}.  There are also differences, as Oxide doesn't model
boxes explicitly and has no clear means to model heap allocated
memory.  The comprehensive work of Jung {\em et al.} provides a
machine-checked formalisation for a realistic subset of
Rust~\cite{JJKD18}.  This includes various notions of concurrency and
extends to libraries using \lstinline{unsafe} features by identifying
{\em library-specific verification conditions} which must be satisfied
to ensure overall safety.  However, concessions were understandably
necessary given the enormity of this formalisation task (which, in
fact, amounts to roughly 17.5KLOC of Coq).  For example, the system
presented does not resemble the surface syntax of Rust but, rather, is
more akin to the {\em Mid-level Intermediate Representation (MIR)}
used within the Rust compiler.  Separately, Jung {\em et al.} explored
compiler optimisations in the context of unsafe code~\cite{JDKJD20}.
This is challenging because, within unsafe code, the usual guarantees
provided by Rust may not hold (e.g.multiple mutable borrows of the
same location can exist).  The proposed system, {\em Stacked Borrows},
provides an operational semantics for memory accesses in Rust.  This
introduces a strong notion of {\em undefined behaviour} such that a
compiler is permitted to ignore the possibility of such programs when
applying optimisations (roughly in line with how C compilers handle
undefined behaviour~\cite{MGDKRWS19})


%Underpinning this development is {\em Iris} --- a framework for
%high-order concurrent separation logic~\cite{JKBD16,KDDLV17,JKJBBD18}.
%This enables, for example, a notion of {\em borrow propositions} which
%correspond with borrowing in Rust.


The potential hazards of \lstinline{unsafe} code have been a
considerable focus of academic work and, indeed, numerous bugs and
security advisories have already been uncovered in real-world
programs~\cite{BKALK21,XCSZ20}.  Interest has been growing in using
state-of-the-art verification tools here.  For example, Rudra employs
a straightforward static analysis to scan for bug patterns related to
error handling~\cite{BKALK21}.  Nevertheless, the tool identified 74
new CVE's (including two in the standard library).  Another good
example is SMACK~\cite{BCDJL06,MB08} which translates LLVM IR to
Boogie/Z3 and was recently extended to Rust~\cite{BHR18}.
CRUST~\cite{TPT15} is similar, but uses CBMC~\cite{KT14} as the
backend.  CRUST specifically focuses on memory safety violations
(e.g. multiple mutable references to the same data).  An interesting
feature is support for automatically deriving ``proof drivers'' using
a technique reminiscent of that for test case generation~\cite{PE07}.
KLEE employs symbolic execution and was also extended to support
Rust~\cite{LAL18,LFEL19}.  Unlike CRUST this tool considers a larger
number of errors, including arithmetic overflow and buffer overruns
(i.e. not just those related to memory unsafety).  Prusti exploits
automated theorem proving as the core technique, building on
Viper~\cite{AMPS19}.  This makes Prusti more comparable with tools
such as Dafny~\cite{Leino10,Leino12} and Whiley~\cite{Pea15c,UPG17}
which require additional programmer annotations to verify
memory-safety properties (e.g.  adding specifications to clarify
method side-effects, etc).  However, Prusti exploits aliasing
information inherent in Rust programs to avoid much of this.  Instead,
programmers can focus on specifying properties of interest, such as
the absence of arithmetic overflow or buffer overruns.  Unfortunately,
Prusti does not consider \lstinline{unsafe} code (though it presumably
could be managed with further specification).  Finally, other relevant
tools include Miri~\cite{Ols16,JDKJD20} (a partially symbolic
interpreter for MIR) and RustHorn~\cite{MTK20} (a specialised verifier
based on Constrained Horn Clauses).
